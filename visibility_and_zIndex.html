## Visibility and Z-Index ##

1.) CSS Visibility Property:-
   -Visibility property is used to hide or show an HTML element without changing the layout of the page.
   -The hidden element uses the space on the page because it is still there, but it is not visible to the user.
   -Difference Between display:none; and visibility:hidden; 
    There is a minor difference between the display: none; and visibility:hidden; property of CSS. 
    1.When we used display:none; box is completely removed from the webpage, and there is no empty space left on the page.
    2. when we used the visibility: hidden property, the box element was still occupying the space.

2.)Z-Index Property In CSS :
   -At the starting of this tutorial, we created four boxes of different colours. Now, try to answer this question:
    What if one box overlaps the other? Which box will be visible to the user? This is where z-index property comes 
    into the picture. So, whenever HTML elements collapse with each other, then the element with smaller z-index 
    value will be covered by the element with larger z-index value.

   -Note: Z-index does not work on static position value. It only works on the elements with position: relative, 
    absolute, fixed, or sticky.
